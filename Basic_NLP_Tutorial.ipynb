        "    Signal processing related to human hearing: The human ear interprets signals that are nearly periodic signals to be exactly periodic. This is just like the case where an autocorrelated signal exhibits slightly different maxima-values at regular intervals of time.\n",
        "    Vocal processing: Correlation can help to determine the tempo or pitch associated with musical signals. The reason is the fact that the autocorrelation can effectively be used to identify repetitive patterns in any given signal.\n",
        "    Determining synchronization pulses: The synchronization pulses in a received signal, which in turn facilitates the process of data retrieval at the receiver's end. This is because the correlation of the known synchronization pulses with the incoming signal exhibits peaks when the sync pulses are received in it. This point can then be used by the receiver as a point of reference, which makes the system understand that the part of the signal following from then on (until another peak is obtained in the correlated signal indicating the presence of sync pulse) contains data.\n",
        "    Radar engineering: Correlation can help determine the presence of a target and its range from the radar unit. When a target is present, the signal sent by the radar is scattered by it and bounced back to the transmitter antenna after being highly attenuated and corrupted by noise. If there is no target, then the signal received will be just noise. Now, if we correlate the arriving signal with the signal sent, and if we obtain a peak at a certain point, then we can conclude that a target is present. Moreover, by knowing the time-delay (indicated by the time-instant at which the correlated signal exhibits a peak) between the sent and received signals, we can even determine the distance between the target and the radar.\n",
        "    Interpreting digital communications through noise: As demonstrated above, correlation can aid in digital communications by retrieving the bits when a received signal is corrupted heavily by noise. Here, the receiver correlates the received signal with two standard signals which indicate the level of '0' and '1', respectively. Now, if the signal highly correlates with the standard signal which indicates the level of '1' more than with the one which represents '0', then it means that the received bit is '1' (or vice versa).\n",
        "    Impulse response identification: As demonstrated above, cross-correlation of a system's output with its input results in its impulse response, provided the input is zero mean unit variance white Gaussian noise.\n",
        "    Image processing: Correlation can help eliminate the effects of varying lighting which results in brightness variation of an image. Usually this is achieved by cross-correlating the image with a definite template wherein the considered image is searched for the matching portions when compared to a template (template matching). This is further found to aid the processes like facial recognition, medical imaging, navigation of mobile robots, etc.\n",
        "    Linear prediction algorithms: In prediction algorithms, correlation can help guess the next sample arriving in order to facilitate the compression of signals.\n",
        "    Machine learning: Correlation is used in branches of machine learning, such as in pattern recognition based on correlation clustering algorithms. Here, data points are grouped into clusters based on their similarity, which can be obtained by their correlation.\n",
        "    SONAR: Correlation can be used in applications such as water traffic monitoring. This is based on the fact that the correlation of the signals received by various shells will have different time-delays and thus their distance from the point of reference can be found more easily.\n",
